Notes
----

Create text files containing raw data which represent all cards in a deck. This could be done using a letter representing a suit then a number/letter representing value/face cards. OR numbers could represent suits.
Letter number version could be H,D,C,S for heart, diamond, club and spade, followed by 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K

So, create raw data.
